Passengers arriving at three planes at the same time are transported by minibuses. 
The load of the planes is exactly n passengers. Minibuses have a capacity 
of 6, or 7, or 8 passengers and go to 4 different cities. The minibuses must be 100% full, 
except for the minibuses with the last passengers. Passengers are travelling in families
of 1 to 4 people. Families should not be divided into minibuses. Create a synchronized 
multithreaded system with synchronisation by minibus
